As African governments accelerate the adoption of technology and pursue an ambitious regional eTrade and eCommerce agenda through the USD $3.2 trillion African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a unique opportunity exists for African governments to employ RegTech solutions to greatly reduce the administrative burden and costs of ensuring firms and individuals are compliant when doing business both within and between African borders.
